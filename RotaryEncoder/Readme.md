Blue Pill STM32-F103-C8 Rotary Encoder Test Circuit and Code
* Ref: https://deepbluembedded.com/stm32-timer-encoder-mode-stm32-rotary-encoder-interfacing/

Circuit Connections:
Generic Rotary Encoder + Push Switch Module with integrated 10k pull up resistors
```
* PA0 -> CLK (10k PullUp)
* PA1 -> DT  (10k PullUp)
* PA2 -> SW  (10k PullUp)
* 3V3 -> +V
* GND -> GND
```
* Set up timer2 to operate in encoder mode with 2 input channels (combined)
* Set up a GPIO input pin to be connected to encoderâ€™s SW switch button pin
* Set up UART1 module to operate in async mode @ 9600bps
* Read the timer2 counter register value and print the number via serial port as well as the button state
